# Introdução a Ciência dos Dados (Introduction to Data Science)
I took this course during my 2nd year at UFMG.

The final project consists of a jupyter notebook analyzing the [Suicides Rate Overview 1985 to 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016) dataset. More information about the project can be found in the notebook itself (although all of it is in portuguese). The notebook also contains a link to a video I've recorded explaining the project.
