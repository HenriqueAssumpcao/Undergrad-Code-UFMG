## Pesquisa Operacional (Operational Research)
I took this course during my 3rd year at UFMG.

The first project is a python implementation of the Simplex algorithm. I intentionally decided to try a non-conventional implementation based on computing the inverses of some matrices that end up being equivalent to what the original simplex algorithm does. However, the code ended up quite convoluted as a result.

The second project is a python implementation of the Hungarian matching algorithm for bipartite graphs.

Both projects have no internal directory structure as per the Professor's instructions, and both have no documentations (only comments in the source files).
