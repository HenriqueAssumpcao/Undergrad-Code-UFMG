## Redes de Computadores (Computer Networks)
I took this course during my 4th year at UFMG.

The first project is a C implementation of the Minesweeper game via a simple server-client architecture using the TCP protocol. The client plays the game remotely via messages sent to the server. The server can only accept a single client at a time, and the implementation is mostly based on the socket library for C.

The second project is a C implementation of an online forum using a central server with multiple connected clients via the TCP protocol. The clients can create new blog posts and interact with each other, and the implementation mainly uses the socket and pthreads libraries for C.

Both projects have documentations (in portuguese) that can be found in their respective Docs.pdf files.
