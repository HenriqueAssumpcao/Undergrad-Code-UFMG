## Fundamentos de Sistemas Paralelos e Distribu√≠dos (Parallel Programming and Distributed Systems)
I took this course during my 4th year at UFMG.

The first project is a simple producer-consumer problem implemented using pthreads in C.

The second project is a distributed key-value storage system using gRPC.
