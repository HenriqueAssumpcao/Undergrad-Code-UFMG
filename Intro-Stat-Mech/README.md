## Introdução a Física Estatística Computacional (Introduction to Computation Statistical Mechanics)
I took this course during my 3rd year at UFMG.

This folder contains all of the jupyter notebooks we've developed throughout the course. They contain python implementations and experiments related to statistical mechanics, e.g. Monte Carlo Methods, Metropolis algorithm for the Ising Model, Simulated Annealing, etc. The notebooks are structured as self-contained reports (in portuguese), so please refer to them for further information about each project.
