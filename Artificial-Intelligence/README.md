## Introdução a Inteligência Artificial (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)
I took this course during my 4th year at UFMG.

The first project is a python implementation of multiple search algorithms, e.g., BFS, DFS, DJIKSTRA, HCS, etc.

The second project is a python implementation of the KNN and KMeans algorithms.

Both projects have documentations (in portuguese). The first one can be found in the respective Docs.pdf file, and the second can be found in the main jupyter notebook.
