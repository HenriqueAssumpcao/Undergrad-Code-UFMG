# √Ålgebra A (Number Theory and Basic Algebra)
I took this course during my 2nd year at UFMG.

All three projects are C implementations of various classical algorithms related to number theory. They all use the gmp library in C.

The contents of each project are described as follows:
* First Project: Modular arithmetic (euclid's algorithm, binary exponentiation, etc)
* Second Project: Primality tests (Miller-Rabin,etc)
* Third Project: Basic RSA Criptography

Due to their simplicity, all projects have no documentations (only comments in the source files).
