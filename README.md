# Undergrad-Code-UFMG
Repository containing the implementations for various projects from courses I took during Undergrad CS at UFMG.

The main purpose of this repository is to keep a record of the projects I've done throughout my undergrad course, and also to get an overview of my development as a programmer.

Some of the projects are a bit disorganized, and a lot of my earlier code is expectedly amateurish, but I do not plan to add to any of the projects to make them more acessible and/or easier to use, as this is not the purpose of this repository. However, if there is any interest on a specific project, please feel free to contact me.
