# Algoritmos 1 (Algorithms 1)
I took this course during my 2nd year at UFMG.

The first project is a C++ implementation of a modified version of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the stable matching problem.

The second project is a C++ implementation of Prim's algorithm for finding a min-cost generating three of a undirected weighted graph.

The third project is a C++ implementation of a Dynamic Programming algorithm that solves a specific problem proposed by our professor.

All projects have documentations (in portuguese), and they can all be found in their respective Documentação.pdf files.
