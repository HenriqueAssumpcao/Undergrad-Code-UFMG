PREFATORY NOTE 

A.G.R.C. A.R.G.C 

THIS translation of the First Book of the "Lemegeton" (now for the 
first time made accessible to English adepts and students of the 
Mysteries) was done, after careful collation and edition, from numer- 
ous MSS. in Hebrew, Latin, French and English, by G. H. Fra. D.D.C.F., 
by the order of the Secret Chief of the Rosicrucian Order. 1 The G. H. 
Fra., having succumbed unhappily to the assaults of the Four Great 
Princes (acting notably under Martial influences), it seemed expedient 
that the work should be brought to its conclusion by another hand. The 
investigations of a competent Skryer into the house of our unhappy Fra., 
confirmed this divination; neither our Fra. nor his Hermetic Mul. were 
there seen; but only the terrible shapes of the evil Adepts S.V.A. 2 and 
H., whose original bodies having been sequestered by Justice, were no 

1 Mr A. E. Waite writes ("Real History of the Rosicrucians," p. 426): "I beg 
leave to warn my readers that all persons who proclaim themselves to be Rosicrucians 
are simply members of pseudo-fraternities, and there is that difference between 
their assertion and the fact of the case in which the essence of a lie consists!" 

It is within the Editor's personal knowledge that Mr. Waite was (and still is 
probably) a member of a society claiming to be the R.C. fraternity. 

As Mr. Waite constantly hints in his writings that he is in touch with initiated 
centres, I think the syllogism, whose premisses are given above, is fair, if not quite 
formal. — Ed. 

2 It was owing to our Fra. receiving this S.V.A. as his Superior, and giving up 
the Arcana of our Fraternity into so unhallowed a power, that We decided no longer 
to leave Our dignity and authority in the hands of one who could be thus easily 
imposed upon. (For by a childish and easy magical trick did S.V.A. persuade 
D.D.C.F. of that lie.) 



longer of use to them. On this we stayed no longer Our Hand; but 
withdrawing Ourselves, and consulting the Rota, and the Books M. and 
Q. did decide to ask Mr. Aleister Crowley, 1 a poet, and skilled student of 
Magical Lore, and an expert Kabbalist, to complete openly that which 
had been begun in secret. This is that which is written: "His Bishoprick 
let another take." And again: "Oculi Tetragrammaton." This is also that 
which is said: "Nomen Secundum pt? STHp refertur ad Gebhurah; qui est 
Rex secundus, quo moriente delabebantur Posteriora Matris, unde 
Bittul atque Corruptio Achurajum Patris et Matris hoc indigitatur." 
And so saying we wish you well. 

Ex Deo Nascimur. 
In Jesu Morimur. 
Per S.S. Reviviscimus. 

Given forth from our Mountain of A., 
this day of C.C. 1903 A.D. 

1 The task of editing the MSS. thus placed in my hands has proved practically a 
sinecure. The original translator and editor had completed his work so efficiently 
that very little was left for me to do beyond undertaking the business transactions 
connected with it, reading the proofs, and deciphering, with transliteration from the 
Enochian characters, the "Angelic" version of Perdurabo, from the priceless MS. 
entrusted to me. — Ed. 

2 He that is appointed to complete in secret that which had been begun openly is 
R.R., and to be heard of at the care of the Editor.

Ceremonial Spagtc 1 

IT is loftily amusing to the student of magical literature who is not 
quite a fool — and rare is such a combination! — to note the criticism 
directed by the Philistine against the citadel of his science. Truly, 
since our childhood has ingrained into us not only literal belief in the 
Bible, but also substantial belief in Alf Laylah wa Laylah, 2 and only 
adolescence can cure us, we are only too liable, in the rush and energy 
of dawning manhood, to overturn roughly and rashly both these 
classics, to regard them both on the same level, as interesting 
documents from the standpoint of folk-lore and anthropology, and as 
nothing more. 

Even when we learn that the Bible, by profound and minute study 
of the text, may be forced to yield up Qabalistic arcana of cosmic 
scope and importance, we are too often slow to apply a similar 
restorative to the companion volume, even if we are the lucky holders 
of Burton's veritable edition. 

To me, then, it remains to raise the Alf Laylah wa Laylah into its 
proper place once more. 

I am not concerned to deny the reality of all "magical" phenomena; 
if they are illusions, they are at least as real as many unquestioned 
facts of daily life; and, if we follow Herbert Spencer, they are at least 
evidence of some cause. 3 

Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion of 
seeing a spirit in the triangle of Art? 

Every smatterer, every expert in psychology, will answer: "That 
cause lies in your brain." 

1 Introductory Essay. By Aleister Crowley. 
"A Thousand and One Nights," commonly called "Arabian Nights." 

-3 

~ This, incidentally, is perhaps the greatest argument we possess, pushed to its extreme, 
against the Advaitist theories. 



English children are taught (pace the Education Act) that the 
Universe lies in infinite Space; Hindu children, in the Akasa, which is 
the same thing. 

Those Europeans who go a little deeper learn from Fichte, that the 
phenomenal Universe is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, or 
Europeans studying under Hindu Gurus, are told, that by Akasa is 
mean the Chitakasa. The Chitakasa is situated in the "Third Eye," 
i.e., in the brain. By assuming higher dimensions of space, we can 
assimilate this face to Realism; but we have no need to take so much 
trouble. 

This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense- 
impressions are dependent on changes in the brain, 1 we must include 
illusions, which are after all sense-impressions as much as "realities" 
are, in the class of "phenomena dependent on brain-changes." 

Magical phenomna, however, come under a special sub-class, since 
they are willed, and their cause is the series of "real" phenomena 
called the operations of ceremonial Magic. 

These consist of: 

(1) Sight. 

The circle, square, triangle, vessels, lamps, robes, imple- 
ments, etc. 

(2) Sound. 

The invocations. 

(3) Smell. 

The perfumes. 

(4) Taste. 

The Sacraments. 

(5) Touch. 

As under (1) 

(6) Mind. 

The combination of all these and reflection on their 
significance. 

These unusual impressions (1-5) produce unusual brain-changes; 
hence their summary (6) is of unusual kind. Its projection back into 
the apparently phenomenal world is therefore unusual. 

1 Thought is a secretion of the brain (Weissman). Consciousness is a function of the brain 
(Huxley). 



Herein then consists the reality of the operations and effects of 
ceremonial magic, 1 and I conceive that the apology is ample, so far as 
the "effects" refer only to those phenomena which appear to the 
magician himself, the appearance of the spirit, his conversation, 
possible shocks from imprudence, and so on, even to ecstasy on the 
one hand, and death or madness on the other. 

But can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia be 
obtained, and if so, can you give a rational explanation of the 
circumstances? Say you so? 

I can, and will. 

The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain. 

Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer's projected cube) 
methods of stimulating or regulating those particular spots (through 
the eye). 

The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish: 

(a) General control of the brain. (Establishment of functions 
relative to the subtle world). 

(b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit). 

(c) Control over one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.) 

The perfumes aid this through smell. Usually the perfume will 
only tend to control a large area; but there is an attribution of 
perfumes to letters of the alphabet enabling one, by a Qabalistic 
formula, to spell out the Spirit's name. 

I need not enter into more particular discussion of these points; the 
intelligent reader can easily fill in what is lacking. 

If, then, I say, with Solomon: 

"The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic," what I mean is: 

"Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty 
may be stimulated and developed by following out the process called 
'The Invocation of Cimieries.'" 

And this is a purely materialistic rational statement; it is 
independent of any objective hierarchy at all. Philosophy has nothing 
to say; and Science can only suspend judgement, pending a proper 
and methodical investigation of the facts alleged. 

1 Apart from its value in obtaining one-pointedness. On this subject the curious may 
consult my !Ttyi$*TS. [Berashith, an Essay in Ontology: later bound up with The Sword of Song and in vol. ii 
of AC's Collected Works. - T.S.] 



Unfortunately, we cannot stop there. Solomon promises us that we 
can (i) obtain information; (2) destroy our enemies; (3) understand the 
voices of nature; (4) obtain treasure; (5) heal diseases, etc. I have 
taken these five powers at random; considerations of space forbid me 
to explain all. 

(1) Brings up facts from sub-consciousness. 

(2) Here we come to an interesting fact. It is curious to note the 
contrast between the noble means and the apparently vile ends of 
magical rituals. The latter are disguises for sublime truths. "To 
destroy our enemies" is to realise the illusion of duality, to excite 
compassion. (Ah! Mr. Waite, 1 the world of Magic is a mirror, 
wherein who sees muck is muck.) 

(3) A careful naturalist will understand much from the voices of the 
animals he has studied long. Even a child knows the difference between 
a cat's miauling and purring. The faculty may be greatly developed. 

(4) Business capacity may be stimulated. 

(5) Abnormal states of the body may be corrected, and the involved 
tissues brought back to tone, in obedience to currents started from the 
brain. 

So for all the other phenomena. There is no effect which is truly 
and necessarily miraculous. 

Our Ceremonial Magic fines down, then, to a series of minute, 
though of course empirical, physiological experiments, and whoso 
will carry them through intelligently need not fear the result. 

I have all the health, and treasure, and logic I need; I have no time 
to waste. "There is a lion in the way." For me these practices are 
useless; but for the benefit of others less fortunate I give them to the 
world, together with this explanation of, and apology for, them. 

I trust that this explanation will enable many students who have 
hitherto, by a puerile objectivity in their view of the question, 
obtained no results, to succeed; that the apology may impress upon 
our scornful men of science that the study of the bacillus should give 
place to that of the baculum, the little to the great — how great one 
only realises when one identifies the wand with the Mahalingam, 2 up 
which Brahma flew at the rate of 84,000 yojanas a second for 84,000 

1 A poet of great ability. He edited a book called "Of Black Magic and of Pacts" in which 
he vilifies the same. 

The Phallus of Shiva the Destroyer. It is really identical with the Qabalistic "Middle 
Pillar" of the "Tree of Life." 



mahakalpas, down which Vishnu flew at the rate of 84,000 crores of 
yojanas a second for 84,000 crores of mahakalpas — yet neither 
reached an end. 

But I reach an end. 
Boleskine House 

Foyers, N.B., July, 1903. 

Note. — I had intended in this place to devote a little attention to 
the edition (save the mark) of the "Goetia" produced by Mr. A. E. 
Waite in the "Book of Black Magic." 

But a fresh persusal of that work reveals it to be such a farrago of 
twenty-fifth-rate shoddy schoolboy journalism that disgust compels 
me to refrain. I may merely mention that the letterpress is garbled and 
the seals abominably drawn. To give one concrete example: on p. 202 
Mr. Waite observes: 

"This" (that the compiler of the Lemegeton was acquainted with 
the N. T.) "is proved by the references in the Third Conjuration to the 
Living Creatures of the Apocalypse." 

There is no such reference! 

In the Second Conjuration, for I have corrected Mr. Waite' s 
careless blunder, there is a reference to Living Creatures; there is also 
a reference to the same beings in the Apocalypse. 

The argument then stands: 

The Book of Chronicles refers to King Solomon (unknown date). 

Mr. Waite refers to King Solomon (1898). 

Therefore, 

The author of the Book of Chronicles was acquainted with Mr. 
Waite 's book. 1 

We will conclude by condoling with the author of the Book of 
Chronicles. 

1 Even apart from this, if Living Creatures are really existent things — which the name 
would suggest — the argument stands: 

The Rig- Veda, 

The Old Testament, 

The Insidecompletuar Britanniaware, 

The Sword of Song 
all refer to the Sun. 

.-. there is a common source in literature. 

Mr Waite' s fallacy is all very well, though, for people who have never kept Living 
Creatures, nor even made a fourth at Bridge. 



LEMEGETON VEL CLAVICULA SALOMONIS REGIS 
PRELIMINARY DEFINITION OF MAGIC. 1 

MAGIC is the Highest, most Absolute, and most Divine Knowledge of 
Natural Philosophy, advanced in its works and wonderful operations 
by a right understanding of the inward and occult virtue of things; so 
that true Agents 2 being applied to proper Patients, 3 strange and 
admirable effects will thereby be produced. Whence magicians are 
profound and diligent searchers into Nature; they, because of their 
skill, know how to anticipate an effort, 4 the which to the vulgar shall 
seem to be a miracle. 

Origen saith that the Magical Art doth not contain anything 
subsisting, but although it should, yet that it must not be Evil, or 
subject to contempt or scorn; and doth distinguish the Natural Magic 
from that which is Diabolical. 

Apollonius Tyannaeus only exercised the Natural Magic, by the 
which he did perform wonderful things. 

Philo Hebraeus saith that true Magic, by which we do arrive at the 
understanding of the Secret Works of Nature, is so far from being con- 
temptible that the greatest Monarchs and Kings have studied it. Nay! 
among the Persians none might reign unless he was skilful in this 
Great Art. 

This Noble Science often degenerateth, from Natural becometh Dia- 
bolical, and from True Philosophy tumeth unto Nigromancy. 5 The which 
is wholly to be charged upon its followers, who, abusing or not being 
capable of that High and Mystical Knowledge do immediately 
hearken unto the temptations of Sathan, and are misled by him into 

1 This Preliminary Definition of Magic is found in very few Codices, and is probably later 
than the body of the work. 
Or Actives. 

3 Or Passives. 

4 Or Effect. 

5 Or the Black Art, as distinct from mere Necromancy, or Divination by the Dead. 



the Study of the Black Art. Hence it is that Magic lieth under disgrace, 
and they who seek after it are vulgarly esteemed Sorcerers. 

The Fraternity of the Rosie Crusians thought it not fit to style 
themselves Magicians, but rather Philosophers. And they be not 
ignorant Empiricks, 1 but learned and experienced Physicians, whose 
remedies be not only Lawful but Divine. 



THE BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION 

(N.B. This is taken from several MS. Codices, of which the four principal 
variations are here composed together in parallel collumns as an example 
of the close argreement of the various texts of the Lemegeton. 

For in the whole work the differences in the wording of the various 
Codices are not sufficient to require the constant giving of parallel 
readings; but except in the more ancient examples there is much 
deterioration in the Seals and Sigils, so that in this latter respect the more 
recent examplars are not entirely reliable.)

Angel with Claps of 
Thunder; without

from these Notes it is 
called the NOTARY 
Art, etc. 



These Most Sacred 
Mysteries were re- 
vealed unto Solomon. 



Now in this Book LEMEGETON is contained the whole Art of King 
Solomon. And although there be many other Books that are said to be 
his, yet none is to be compared hereunto, for this containeth them all. 
Though there be titles with several other Names of the Book, as The 
Book HELISOL, which is the very same with this last Book of 
Lemegeton called Ars Nova or Ars Notoria, etc. 

These Books were first found in the Chaldee and Hebrew Tongues 
at Jerusalem by a Jewish Rabbi; and by him put into the Greek 
language and thence into the Latin, as it is said. 1 

1 The first only of these five books is here published; the astral opposition incidental to 
the publication of any magical writing is not to be blamed for this; but the engorgement of the 
translator in a matter of other import, as previously hinted. This true life of this man and his 
associates, with a veridic account of their researches into magical arts, etc., may be looked for 
in my forthcoming volume:

hold a Hazel Wand in his hand, striking it out towards 
the South and East Quarters, make a triangle, A, 
without the Circle, and then command him into it by 
the Bonds and Charges of Spirits as hereafter 
followeth. And if he doth not enter into the triangle, 
A, at your threats, rehearse the Bonds and Charms 
before him, and then he will yield Obedience and 
come into it. and do what he is commanded by the 
Exorcist. Yet he must receive him courtesously 
because he is a Great King, and do homage unto him, 
as the Kings and Princes do that attend upon him. And 
thou must have always a Silver Ring in the middle 
finger or the left hand held against thy face, 1 as they do 
yet before AMAYMON. This Great King Beleth 
causeth all the love that may be, both of Men and of

34 



THESE be the 72 Mighty Kings and Princes which King Solomon Com- 
manded into a Vessel of Brass, together with their Legions. Of whom 
Belial, Bileth, Asmoday, and Gaap, were Chief. And it is to be noted 
that Solomon did this because of their pride, for he never declared other 
reason why he thus bound them. And when he had thus bound them up 
and sealed the Vessel, he by Divine Power did chase them all into a deep 
Lake or Hole in Babylon. And they of Babylon, wondering to see such 
a thing, they did then go wholly into the Lake, to break the Vessel open, 
expecting to find great store of Treasure therein. But when they had 
broken it open, out flew the Chief Spirits immediately, with their Legions 
following them; and they were all restored to their former places except 
Belial, who entered into a certain Image, and thence gave answers unto 
those who did offer Sacrifices unto him, and did worship the Image as 
their God, etc. 

OBSERVATIONS 

First, thou shalt know and observe the Moon's Age for thy working. The 
best days be when the Moon Luna is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 days old, as 
Solomon saith; and no other days be profitable. The Seals of the 72 Kings 
are to be made in Metals. The Chief Kings' in Sol (Gold); Marquis' in 
Luna (Silver); Dukes' in Venus (Copper); Prelacies' in Jupiter (Tin); 
Knights' in Saturn (Lead); Presidents' in Mercury (Mercury); Earls' in 
Venus (Copper), and Luna (Silver), alike equal, etc. 

These 72 Kings be under the Power of Amaymon, Corson, Zimimay or 
ZIMINIAR, and GOAP, who are the Four Great Kings ruling in the Four 
Quarters, or Cardinal Points, 1 viz: East, West, North, and South, and are 
not to be called forth except it be upon Great Occasions; but are to be 
Invocated and Commanded to send such or such a Spirit that is under their 
Power and Rule, as is shown in the following Invocations and 
Conjurations. And the Chief Kings may bne bound from 9 till 12 o'clock 
at Noon, and from 3 till sunset; Marquises may be found from 3 in the 
afternoon till 9 at Night, and from 9 at Night till Sunrise; Dukes may be 
bound from Sunrise till Noonday in Clear Weather; Prelates may be bound 
any hour of the Day; Knights may from Dawning of Day till Sunrise, or 

1 These four Great Kings are usually called Oriens, or Uriens, Paymon or Paymonia, Ariton 
or Egyn, and Amaymon or Amaimon. By the Rabbins they are frequently entitled: Samael, 
Azazel, Azael, and Mahazael. 



35 



from 4 o'clock till Sunset; Presidents may be bound at any time, excepting 
Twilight, at Night, unless the King whom they are under be Invocated; and 
Counties or Earls any hour of the Day, so it be in Woods, or in any other 
places whither men resort not, or where no noise is, etc.

[[t)]] (Seal in Lead.) Knights: (50.) Furcas. 

Note. — It will be remarked that several among the above Spirits possess 
two titles of different ranks: e.g., (45.) Vine is both King and Earl; (25.) 
Glasya-Labolas is both President and Earl, etc. "Prince" and "Prelate" are 
apparently used as interchangeable terms. Probably the Seals of Earls 
should be made in Iron, and those of Presidents in mixture either of 
Copper and Silver, or of Silver and Mercury; as otherwise the Metal of 



36 



one Planet, Mars, is excluded from the List; the Metals attributed to the 
Seven Planets being: to Saturn, Lead; to Jupiter, Tin; to Mars, Iron; to the 
Sun, Gold; to Venus, Copper; to Mercury, Mercury and mixtures of 
Metals, and to Luna, Silver. 

IN a manuscript codex by Dr. Rudd, which is in the British Museum, 
Hebrew names of these 72 Spirits are given; but it appears to me that many 
are manifestly incorrect in orthography. The codex in question, though 
beautifully written, also contains many other errors, particularly in the 
Sigils. Such as they are, these names in the Hebrew of Dr. Rudd are here

THE MAGICAL CIRCLE 

THIS is the Form of the Magical Circle of King Solomon, the which he 
made that he might preserve himself therein from the malice of these Evil 
Spirits. (See plate, facing.) This Magical Circle is to be made 9 feet 
across, and the Divine Names are to be written round it, beginning at 
EHYEH, and ending at LEVANAH, Luna. 

(Colours. — The space between the outer and inner circles, where the 
serpent is coiled, with the Hebrew names written along his body, is bright 
deep yellow. The square in the centre of the circle, where the word 
"Master" is written, is filled in with red. All names and letters are black. 
In the Hexagrams the outer trianagles where the letters A, D, o, N, A, I, 
appear are filled in with bright yellow, the centres, where the T-shaped 
crosses are, blue or green. In the Pentagrams outside the circle, the outer 
triangles where "Te, tra, gram, ma, ton," is written are filled in bright 
yellow, and the centres with the T crosses written therein are red. 1 ) 

THE MAGICAL TRIANGLE OF SOLOMON 

THIS is the form of the Magical Triangle, into the which Solomon did 
command the Evil Spirits. It is to be made at 2 feet distance from the 
Magical Circle and it is 3 feet across. (See plate, facing.) Note that this 
triangle is to be placed toward that quarter whereunto the Spirit 
belongeth. And the base of the triangle is to be nearest unto the Circle, 
the apex pointing in the direction of the quarter of the Spirit. Observe 
thou talso the Moon in thy working, as aforesaid, etc. Anaphaxeton is 
sometimes written Anepheneton. 

1 The coiled serpent is only shown in one private codex, the Hebrew names being in most 
cases simply written round in a somewhat spiral arrangement within the double circle. It is to be 
remembered that Hebrew is always written from right to left, instead of from left to right like 
ordinary European languages. The small Maltese crosses are placed to mark the conclusion of 
each separate set of Hebrew names. These names are those of Deity Angels and Archangels 
allotted by the Qabalists to each of the 9 first Sephiroth or Divine Emanations. In English letters 
they run thus, beginning from the head of the serpent: + Ehyeh Kether Metatron Chaioth ha- 
Qadesh Rashith ha-Gilgalim S.P.M. (for "Sphere of the Primum Mobile"_ + Iah Chokmah 
Ratziel Auphanim Masloth S.S.F. (for "Sphere of the Fixed Stars," or S.Z. for "Sphere of the 
Zodiac") + Iehovah Elohim Binah Tzaphquiel Aralim Shabbathai S. (for "Sphere") of Saturn + 
El Chesed Tzadquiel Chaschmalin Tzedeq S. of Jupiter + Elohim Gibor Geburah Kamael 
Seraphim Madim S. of Mars + Iehovah Eloah va-Daath Tiphereth Raphae Malakim Shemesh S. 
of the Sun + Iehovah Tzabaoth Netzach Haniel Elohim Nogah S. of Venus + Elohim Tzabaoth 
Hod Michael Beni Elohim Kokav S. of Mercury + Shaddai el Chai Iesod Gabriel Cherubim 
Levanah S. of the Moon +.

The Hexagram of Solomon 




77z£ Pentagram of Solomon 




The Magic Ring or Disc of Solomon 



(Colours. — Triangle outlined in black; name of Michael black on 
white ground; the three Names without the triangle written in red; circle 
in centre entirely filled in in dark green.) 

THE HEXAGRAM OF SOLOMON 

THIS is the Form of the Hexagram of Solomon, the figure whereof is to be 
made on parchment of a calf's skin, and worn at the skirt of thy white 
vestment, and covered with a cloth of fine linen which and pure, the 
which is to be shown unto the Spirits when they do appear, so that they 
be compelled to take human shape upon them and be obedient. 

(Colours. — Circle, Hexagram, and T cross in centre outlined in black, 
Maltese crosses black; the five exterior triangles of the Hexagram where 
Te, tra, gram, ma, ton, is written, are filled in with bright yellow; he T 
cross in centre is red, with three little squares therein in black. The 
lower exterior triangle, where the Sigil is drawn in black, is left white. 
The words "Tetragrammaton" and "Tau" are in black letters; and AGLA 
with Alpha and Omega in red leters.) 

THE PENTAGRAM OF SOLOMON 

THIS is the Form of the Pentagram of Solomon, the figure whereof is to 
be made in Sol or Luna (Gold or Silver) and worn upon thy breast; 
having the Seal of the Spirit required upon the other side thereof. It is to 
preserve thee from danger, and also to command the Spirits by. 

(Colours. — Circle and pentagram outlined in black. Names and 
Sigils within Pentagram black also. "Tetragrammaton" in red letters. 
Ground of centre of Pentagram, where "Soluzen" is written, green. Ex- 
ternal angles of Pentagram where "Abdia," "Ballaton," "Halliza," etc., 
are written, blue.) 

THE MAGIC RING OR DISC OF SOLOMON 

This is the Form of the Magic Ring, or rather Disc, of Solomon, the 
figre whereof is to be made in gold or silver. It is to be held before the 
face of the exorcist to preserve him from the stinking sulphurous fumes 
and flaming breath of the Evil Spirits. 
(Colour. — Bright yellow. Letters, black.) 

[See colour plate, facing, for the three above.] 



39 



THE VESSEL OF BRASS 





THIS is the Form of the Vessel of Brass wherein King Solomon did shut up 
the Evil Spirits, etc. (Somewhat different forms are given in the various 
codices. The seal [see figures below] was made is brass to cover this vessel 
with at the top. This history of the genii shut up in the brazen vessel by 
King Solomon recalls the story of "The Fisherman and the Jinni" in "The 
Arabian Nights." In this tale, however, there was only one junni shut up in 
a vessel of yellow brass the which was covered at the top with a leaden seal. 
This jinni tells the fisherman that his name is Sakhr, or Sacar. Colour. — 
Bronze. Letters. — Black on a red band.) 

THE SECRET SEAL OF SOLOMON 





This is the form of the Secret Seal of Solomon, wherewith he did bind and 
seal up the aforesaid Spirits with their legions in the Vessel of Brass. 

The Seal is to be made by one that is clean both inwardly and out- 
wardly, and that hath not defiled himself by any woman in the space of 
a month, but hath in prayer and fasting desired of God to forgive him all 
his sins, etc. 



40 



It is to be made on the day of Mars or Saturn (Tuesday or Saturday) 
at night at 12 o'clock, and written upon virgin parchment with the blood of 
a black cock that never trode hen. Note that on this night the moon must 
be increasing in light (i.e., going from new to full) and in the Zodiacal 
Sign of Virgo. And when the seal is so made thou shalt perfume it with 
alum, raisins dried in the sun, dates, cedar, and lignum aloes. 

Also by this seal King Solomon did command all the aforesaid Spirits 
into the Vessel of Brass, and did seal it up with the same seal. He by it 
gained the love of all manner of persons, and overcame in battle, for neither 
weapons, nor fire, nor water could hurt him. And this privy seal was made 
to cover the vessel at the top withal, etc. 



Note: Figures 162 to 174 inclusive are interesting as showing a 
marked resemblance to the central design of the Secret Seal. It will be 
observed that the evident desire is to represent hieroglpyhically a person 
raising his or her hands in adoration. Nearly all are stone sephulchral 
steles, and the execution of them is rough and primitive in the extreme. 
Most are in the Musee du Louvre at Paris. 






Figure 162. Figure 163. Figure 164. 

Figures 162 and 163 are from the district of Constantine and show a 
figure raising its arms in adoration. In Figure 164, also from Constantine, 
the person bears a palm branch in the right hand. Above is a 
hieroglyphic representing either the Lunar Disc or the Sun in the 
heavens; but more probably the former. 



41 




Figure 165. 




iHKn 




^B^ 



Funic 
Uktcnptio*. 




Figure 166. 



Figure 165 is a more complicated stele. Above is the 
symbol already mentioned, then comes the sign of the 
Pentagram, represented by a five-pointed star, towards 
which the person raises his or her hands. Besides the 
latter is a rude form of caduceus. A brief inscription 
follows in the Punic character. The Punic or Carthaginian 
language is usually considered to have been a dialect of 
Phonician, and Carthage was of course a colony of Tyre. 
Beneath the Punic inscription is a horse's head in better 
drawing than the sculpture of the rest of the stele, which 
would seem to imply that the rudeness of the 
representation of the human figure is intentional. This 
and the following stele are also from Constantine. 

In Figure 166 again, the horse is best delieated by far. 
In addition to the other symbols is also a hand or foot, for 
it is almost impossible to distinguish which, at the head of 
the stele, followed by an egg-and-tounge moulding. The 
figure of the person with the arms raised is treated as a 
pure hieroglpyh and is placed between two rude caducei. 
The Lunar or Solar symbol follows. 





Figure 167. 



Figure 168. 




Figure 169. 



Figure 167, also from Constantine, shows the last-mentioned symbol 
above. The figure with the arms raised is simply a hieroglyph, and is 
placed between and arm and a hand on the one side, and a rude 
caduceus on the other. Figure 168 shows the person holding a rude 
caduceus in the right hand, and standing above a dolphin.. This latter, 
as in the case of the horse in 165 and 166, is by far the best delineated. 
Figure 169, this also being from Constantine, shows the usual human 
hieroglyph between a caduceus and a cresent. 



42 





Figure 170. Figure 171. 

Figure 170 is from the site of ancient Carthage. It is very rough in 
workmanship, and the designs are mere scratchings on the stone. The 
ensemble has the effect of an evil Sigil. Figure 171 is also from 
Carthage and the various symbols appear to have been compressed into 
and synthesised in the form of a peculiarly evil-looking caduceus.

Figure 174. 



Figure 172 is from the decoration of a sepulchral urn found at Olden- 
burgh in Germany. It is remarkable as showing the same hieroglyphic 
human form with the crescent above; the latter in the Secret Seal of 
Solomon has a flattened top, and is therefore more like a bowl, and is 
placed across the hieroglyph. Figure 173 is an Egyptian design which 
would show an analogy between the symbol and the idea of the force of 
creation. Figure 174 is a stele from Phonicia somewhat similar to the 
others, except that the rudimentary caducei in Figures 166 and 170 are 
here replaced by two roughly drawn Ionic columns. These last three 
designs are taken from the work of the Chevalier Emile Soldi-Colbert de 
Beaulieu, on the "Lange Sacree" 

In figure 175 is given the seal of the Spirit HALAHEL. 
This Spirit is said to be under the rule of BAEL, and to 
be of a mixed nature, partly good and partly evil, like 
the spirits of Theurgia-Goetia which follow in the 
second book of the Lemegeton.

THE OTHER MAGICAL REQUISITES. 

THE other magical requisites are: a sceptre, a sword, a mitre, a cap, a long 
white robe of linen, and other garments for the purpose; 1 also a girdle of 
lion's skin three inches broad, with all the names written about it which be 
round the outmost part of the Magic Circle. Also perfumes, and a chafing- 
dish of charcoal kindled to put the fumes on, to smoke or perfume the 
place appointed for action; also anointing oil to anoint thy temples and 
thine eyes with; and fair water to wash thyself in. And in so doing, thou 
shalt say as David said: 

The Adoration at the Bath. 

"Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, O Lord! and I shall be clean : 
Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." 
And at the putting on of thy garments thou shalt say: 

The Adoration at the Induing of the Vestments. 

"By the figurative mystery of these holy vestures (or of this holy 
vestment) I will clothe me with the armour of salvation in the strength of 
the Most High, Ancar; Amacor; Amides; Theodonias; Anitor; that 
my desired end may be effected through Thy strength, O ADONAl! unto 
Whom the praise and glory will for ever and ever belong! Amen!" 

After thou hast so done, make prayers unto God according unto thy 
work, as Solomon hath commanded. 



THE CONJURATION TO CALL FORTH ANY OF 
THE AFORESAID SPIRITS. 

I DO invocate and conjure thee, O Spirit, N. 2 ; and being with power 
armed from the SUPREME MAJESTY, I do strongly command thee, by 
Beralanensis, Baldachiensis, Paumachia, and Apologle Sedes; by 
the most Powerful Princes, Genii, Liachida^ and Ministers of the Tartarean 
Abode; and by the Chief Prince of the Seat of Apologia in the Ninth Legion, 
I do invoke thee, and by invocating conjure thee. And being armed with 

1 In many codices it is written "a sceptre or sword, a mitre or cap." By the "other garments" 
would be meant not only under-garments, but also mantles of different colours. 

Here interpolate the name of the Spirit desired to be invocated. In some of the codices 
there are faint variations in the form of wording of the conjurations, but not sufficient to change 
the sense, e.g. "Tartarean abode" for "Tartarean seat," etc. 



44 



power from the SUPREME MAJESTY, I do strongly command thee, by Him 
Who spake and it was done, and unto whom all creatures be obedient. Also 
I, being made after the image of God, endued with power from God, and 
created according unto His Will, do exorcise thee by that most mighty and 
powerful name of God, El, strong and wonderful; O thou Spirit N. And 
I command thee by Him who spake the Word and His FIAT was accom- 
plished, and by all the names of God. Also by the names Adonai, El, 
Elohim, Elohi, Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh, Zabaoth, Elion, Iah, Tetra- 
GRAMMATON, SHADDAI, Lord GOD MOST HIGH, I do exorcize thee and do 
powerfully command thee, O thou spirit N., that thou dost forthwith appear 
unto me here before this Circle in a fair human shape, without any deformity 
or tortuosity. And by this ineffable name, Tetragrammaton Iehovah, 
do I command thee, at the which being heard the elements are overthrown, 
the air is shaken, the sea runneth back, the fire is quenched, the earth 
trembleth, and all the hosts of the celestials, terrestrials, and infernals do 
tremble together, and are troubled and confounded. Wherefore come thou, 

spirit N., forthwith and without delay, from any or all parts of the 
world wherever thou mayest be, and make rational answers unto all things 
that I shall demand of thee. Come thou peaceably, visibly, and affably, 
now, and without delay, manifesting that which I shall desire. For thou 
art conjured by the name of the Living and True God, Helioren, 
where-fore fulfil thou my commands, and persist thou therein unto the 
end, and according unto mine interest, visibly and affably speaking unto 
me with a voice clear and intelligible without any ambiguity. 

Repeat this conjuration as often as thou pleasest, and if the Spirit 
come not yet, say as followeth: 

THE SECOND CONJURATION 

1 DO invocate, conjure, and command thee, O thou Spirit N., to appear and 
to show thself visibly unto me before this Circle in fair and comely shape, 
without any deformity or tortuosity; by the name and in the name IAH and 
Vau, which Adam heard and spake; and by the name of God, Agla, which 
Lot heard and was saved with his family; and by the name IOTH, which 
Iacob heard from the angel wrestling with him, and was delivered from the 
hand of Esau his brother; and by the name ANAPHAXETON 1 which Aaron 

1 Or "Anapezeton." 



45 



heard and spake and was made wise; and by the name Zabaoth, 1 which 
Moses named and all the rivers were turned into blood; and by the name 
ASHER EHYEH ORISTON, which Moses named, and all the rivers brought 
forth frogs, and they ascended into the houses, destroying all things; and 
by the name Elion, which Moses named, and there was great hail such as 
had not been since the beginning of the world; and by the name ADONAI, 
which Moses named, and there came up locusts, which appeared upon the 
whole land, and devoured all which the hail had left; and by the name 
Schema Amathia which Ioshua called upon, and the sun stayed his course; 
and by the name Alpha and Omega which Daniel named, and destroyed 
Bel, and slew the Dragon; and in the name EMMANUEL, which the three 
children, Shadrach, Meschach and Abed-nego, sang in the midst of the fiery 
furnace, and were delivered; and by the name Hagios; and by the Seal 2 
of Adonai; and by Ischyros, Athanatos, Paracletos; and by O Theos, 
Ictros, Athanatos; and by these three secret names, Agla, On, Tetra- 
grammaton, do I adjure and constrain thee. And by these names, and by 
all the other names of the Living and True God, the Lord Almighty, I 
do exorcize and command thee, O Spirit N., even by Him Who spake the 
Word and it was done, and to Whom all creatures are obedient; and by the 
dreadful judgements of God; and by the uncertain Sea of Glass, which is 
before the Divtne Majesty, mighty and powerful; by the four beasts before 
the throne, having eyes before and behind; by the fire round about the 
throne; by the holy angels of Heaven; and by the mighty wisdom of GOD; 
I do potently exorcise thee, that thou appearest here before this Circle, to 
fulfil my will in all things which shall seem good unto me; by the Seal of 
Basdathea Baldachia; and by this name Primeumaton, which Moses 
named, and the earth opened and did swallow up Kora, Dathan, and 
Abiram. Wherefore thou shalt make faithful answers unto all my demands, 
O Spirit N., and shalt perform all my desires so far as in thine office thou 
art capable hereof. Wherefore, come thou, visibly, peacably, and 
affably, now without delay, to manifest that which I desire, speaking with 
a clear and perfect voice, intelligibly, and to mine understanding. 



1 Or "Tzabaoth." [Heb., nitfSS, hosts or armies] 
In some "By the Seat of Adonai" or "By the Throne of Adonai." In these conjurations and 
elsewhere in the body of the text I have given the divine names as correctly as possible. 

46 



If he come not yet at the rehearsal of these two first conjurations (but 
without doubt he will), say on as followeth; it being a constraint: 

THE CONSTRAINT 

I DO conjure thee, O thou spirit N., by all the most glorious and efficacious 
names of the Most Great and Incomprehensible Lord God of Hosts, 
that thou comest quickly and without delay from all parts and places of the 
earth and world wherever thou mayest be, to make rational answer unto 
my demands, and that visibly and affably, speaking with a voice intelligible 
unto mind understanding as aforesaid. I conjure and constrain thee, O 
thou spirit N., by all the names aforesaid; and in addition by these seven 
great names wherewith Solomon the Wise bound thee and thy companions 
in a Vessel of Brass, Adonai, Preyai (or Prerai), Tetragrammaton, 

ANAPHAXETON (or ANAPHENETON), INESSENFATOAL (or INESSENFATALL), 

Pathtumon (or Pathatumon), and Itemon; that thou appearest here 
before this Circle to fulfil my will in all things that seem good unto me. 
And if thou be still so disobedient, and refusest still to come, I will in 
the power and by the power of the name of the Supreme and 
Everlasting Lord God Who created both thee and me and all the 
world in six days, and what is contained therein, ElE, SARA YE, and by 
the power of this name Primeumaton which commandeththe whole 
host of Heaven, curse thee, and deprive thee of thine office, joy,a dn 
place, and bind thee in the depths of the Bottomless Pit or Abyss, there 
to remain unto the Day of the Last Judgement. And I will bind thee in 
the Eternal Fire, and into the Lake of Flame and of Brimstone, unless 
thou comest quickly and appearest here before this Circle to do my will. 
Therefore, come thou! in and by the holy names ADONAI, ZABAOTH, 
Adonai, Amioran. Come thou! for it is Adonai who commandest thee. 

If thou hast come thus far, and yet he appeareth not, thou mayest be 
sure that he is sent unto some other place by his King, and cannot come; 
and if it be so, invocate the King as here followeth, to send him. But if he 
do not come still, then thou mayest be sure that he is bound in chains in 
hell, and that he is not in the custody of his King. If so, and thou still 
hast a desire to call him even from thence, thou must rehearse the 
general curse which is called the Spirits' Chain. 



47 



Here followeth, therefore, the Invocation of the King: 1 

THE INVOCATION OF THE KING. 

O THOU great, powerful, and mighty King AMAIMON, who bearest rule by 
the power of the Supreme God El over all spirits both superior and inferior 
of the Infernal Order in the Dominion of the East; I do invocate and 
command thee by the especial and true name of God; and by that God 
that Thou Worshippest; and by the Seal of thy creation; and by the most 
mighty and powerful name of God, Iehovah Tetragrammaton who 
cast thee out of heaven with all other infernal spirits; and by all themost 
powerful and great names of God who created Heaven, and Earth, and 
Hell, and all things in them contained; and by their power and virtue; and 
by the name Primeumaton who commandeth the whole host of Heaven; 
that thou mayest cause, enforce, and compel the Spirit N. to come unto me 
here before this Circle in a fair and comely shape, without harm unto me or 
unto any other creature, to answer truly and faithfully unto all my requests; 
so that I may accomplish my will and desire in knowing or obtaining any 
matter or thing which by office thou knowest is proper for him to perform 
or accomplish, through the power of GOD, EL, who created and doth 
dispose of all things both celestial, aerial, terrestrial, and infernal. 

After thou shalt have invocated the King in this manner twice or 
thrice over, then conjure the spirit thou wouldest call forth by the aforesaid 
conjurations, rehearsing them several times together, and he will come 
without doubt, if not at the first or second time of rehearsing. But if he do 
not come, add the "Spirits' Chain" unto the end of the aforesiad conjura- 
tions, and he will be forced to come, even if he be bound in chains, for 
the chains must break off from him, and he will be at liberty. 

THE GENERAL CURSE, CALLED THE SPIRITS' CHAIN, 
AGAINST ALL SPIRITS THAT REBEL. 

O Thou wicked and disobedient spirit N., because thou hast rebelled, and 
hast not obeyed nor regarded my words which I have rehearsed; they 
being all glorious and incomprehensible names of the true GOD, the maker 
and creator of thee and of me, and of all the world; I DO, by the power 

1 It will depend on the quarter to which the Spirit is attributed, which of the four chief kings 
is to be invoked. 



48 



of these names the which no creature is able toresist, curse thee into the 
depths of the Bottomless Abyss, there to remain unto the Day of Doom in 
chains, and in fire and brimstone unquenchable, unless thou forthwith appear 
here before this Circle, in this triangle to do my will. And, therefore, 
come thou quickly and peaceably, in and by these names of GOD, 
Adonai, Zabaoth, adonai, amioran; come thou! come thou! for it is 
the King of Kings, even ADONAI, who commandeth thee. 

When thou shalt have rehearsed thus far, but still he cometh not, then 
write thou his seal on parchment and put thou it into a strong black box; 1 
with brimstone, assafotida, and such like things that bear a stinking smell; 
and then bind the box up round with iron wire, and hang it upon the 
point of thy sword, and hold it over the fire of charcoal; and say as 
followeth unto the fire first, it being placed toward that quarter when the 
Spirit is to come: 

THE CONJURATION OF THE FIRE 

I CONJURE thee, O fire, by him who made thee and all other creatures for 
good in the world, that thou torment, burn, and consume thais Spirit N., for 
everlasting. I condemn thee, thou Spirit N., because thou art disobedient 
and obeyest not my commandment, nor keepest the precepts of the LORD 
THY GOD, neither wilt thou obey me nor mine invocations, having thereby 
called thee forth, I, who am the servant of the Most High and Imperial 
LORD God OF HOSTS, IEHOVAH, I who am dignified and fortified by His 
celestial power and permission, and yet thou comest not to answer these 
my propositions here made unto thee. For the which thine averseness and 
contempt thou art guilty of great disobedience and rebellion, and therefore 
shall I excommunicate thee, and destroy thy name and seal, the which I 
have enclosed in this box; and shall burn thee in the immortal fire and 
bury thee in immortal oblivion; unless thou immediately come and appear 
visibly and affably, friendly and courteously here unto be before this Circle, 
in this triangle, in a form comely and fair, and in no wise terrible, hurtful, 
or frightful to me or any other creature whatsoever upon the face of earth. 
And thou shalt make rational answers unto my requests, and perform all 
my desires in all things, that I shall make unto thee. 

1 This box should evidently be in metal or in something which does not take fire easily, [[d, 
which is the corruption of O, is best.]] 



49 



And if he come not even yet, thou shalt say as followeth: 

THE GREATER CURSE. 1 

NOW, O thou Spirit N., since thou art still pernicious and disobedient, 
and wilt not appear unto me to answer unto such things as I would have 
desired of thee, or would have been satisfied in; I do in the name, and by 
the power and dignity of the Omnipresent and Immortal Lord God of 
Hosts lEHOVAH TETRAGRAMMATON, the only creator of Heaven, and Earth, 
and Hell, and all that is therein, who is the marvellous Disposer of all 
things both visible and invisible, curse thee, and deprive thee of all 
thine office, joy, and place; and I do bind thee in the depths of the 
Bottomless Abyss there to remain until the Day of Judgement, I say into 
the Lake of Fire and Brimstone which is prepared for all rebellious, 
disobedient, obstinate, and pernicious spirits. Let all the company of 
Heaven curse thee! Let the sun, moon, and all the stars curse thee! 
Let the Light and all the hosts of Heaven curse thee even into the fire 
unquenchable, and into the torments unspeakable. And as thy name and 
seal contained in this box chained and bound up, shall be choked in sul- 
phurous stinking substances, and burned in this material fire; so in the 
name lEHOVAH and by the power and dignity of these three names, TETRA- 
GRAMMATON, Anaphaxeton, and Primeumaton, I do cast thee, O thou 
wicked and disobedient Spirit N, into the Lake of Fire which is prepared 
for the damned and accursed spirits, and there to remain unto the day of 
doom, and never more to be remembered before the face of God, who 
shall come to judge the quick, and the dead, and the world, by fire. 

THEN the exorcist must put the box into the fire, and by-and-by the 
Spirit will come, but as soon as he is come, quench the fire that the box is 
in, and make a sweet perfume, and give him welcome and a kind entertain- 
ment, showing unto him the Pentacle that is at the bottom of your 
vesture covered with a linen cloth, saying: 



1 In some codices this is called "the Curse" only; but in one or two the "Spirits' Chain" is 
called "the Lesser Curse," and this the "Greater Curse." 



50 



THE ADDRESS UNTO THE SPIRIT UPON HIS COMING 

BEHOLd thy confusion if thou refusest to be obedient! Behold the Pentacle 
of Solomon which I have brought here before thy presence! Behold the 
person of the exorcist in the midst of the exorcism; him who is armed by 
GOD and without fear; him who potently invocateth thee and calleth thee 
forth unto apperance; even him, thy master, who is called OCTINOMOS. 
Wherefore make rational answer unto my demands, and prepare to be 
obedient unto thy master in the name of the Lord: 

Bathal or Vathat Rushing upon Abrac! 

Abeor coming upon Aberer! 1 

Then he or they will be odedient, and bit thee ask what thou wilt, for 
he or they be subjected by God to fulfil our desires and commands. And 
when he or they shall have appeared and showed himself or themselves 
humbly and meek, then shalt thou rehease: 

THE WELCOME UNTO THE SPIRIT. 

Welcome Spirit N., O most noble king 2 (or 'kings')! I say thou art 
welcome unto me, because I have called thee through Him who hast 
created Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, and all that is in them contained, and 
because also thou hast obeyed. By that same power by the which I have 
called thee, forth, I bind thee, that thou remain affably and visibly here 
before this Circle (or 'before this Circle and in this Triangle') so 
constant and so long as I shall have occasion for thy presence; and not to 
depart without my licence until thou hast duly and faithfull performed 
my will without any falsity. 

THEN standing in the midst of the Circle, thou shalt stretch forth thine 
hand in a gesture of command and say: 

"By the Pentacle of Solomon have I called thee! Give unto 
me a true Answer." 

Then let the exorcist state his desires and requests. 

And when the evocation is finished, thou shalt licence the Spirit to 
depart thus: 

1 In the Latin, "Bathal vel Vathat super Abrac mens! Abeor veniens super Aberer!" [[Hence 
these are not names of G[od] .-. the V[ast] .-. 0[ne] .\ as it would be mentis, venientis.]] 
Or whatever his dignity may be. 



51 



THE LICENCE TO DEPART 

O THOU Spirit N., because thou hast diligently answered unto my 
demands, and hast been very ready and willing to come at my call, I do 
here licence thee to depart unto thy proper place; without causing harm 
or danger unto man or beast. Depart, them I say, and be thou very ready 
to come at my call, being duly exorcised and conjured by the sacred 
rites of magic. I charge thee to withdraw peaceably and quietly, and the 
peace of GOD be ever continued between thee and me! Amen! 



After thou hast given the Spirit licence to depart, thou art not to go 
out of the circle until he or they be gone, and until thou shalt have made 
prayers and rendered thanks unto God for the great blessings He hath 
bestowed upon thee in granting thy desires, and delivering thee from all 
the malice of the enemy the devil. 

Also note! Thou mayest command these spirits into the Vessl of 
Brass in the same manner as thou dost into the triangle, by saying: "that 
thou dost forthwith appear before this Circle, in this Vessel of Brass, in 
a fair and comely shape," etc., as hath been shown in the foregoing 
conjurations.

Notes by the creator of this electronic edition. 

This edition of the Goetia was prepared from the 1976 facsimile reprint published by Equinox 
Books, and the 1993 First Impressions reprint incorporating Crowley's doodles and 
marginalia. Some of the latter have been retained as footnotes, flagged by double square 
brackets [[like this]]. Also consulted were electronic editions of the Goetia and 
Pseudomonarchia dee monum prepared by Joseph Peterson (online at www. esoteric- 
archives .org) and of the other books of the Lemegeton prepared by Ben Rowe (online at 
http://w3.one.net/~browe/ciassics.htm; Rowe's version of the Goetia was prepared 
primarily from the de Laurence piracy). The 1995 Weiser edition (edited by William Breeze 
based on the Mathers-Crowley edition and other sources) was not directly consulted. 

In the printed edition the figures (seals of spirits, diagram of the Circle, etc) were given on 
three full-page plates: one facing the main title, one facing the start of the list of spirits, and 
one before the start of the conjurations. I have inserted the bulk of them in appropriate places 
in the text for ease of comprehension: as such the original pagination has not been retained 
past the start of the list of Spirits. Figures 176-184 from that edition are omitted; these 
belonged with the Theurgia-Goetia, the second book of the Lemegeton. 

"EniKAAOTMAI 2E TON EN Tft KENEft IINETMATI K.T.A." 

This curse is extracted from the Demotic and Greek magical papyrus of London and Leiden, 
now known as PGM XIV / PDM xiv. A semi-popular edition with an English translation, 
edited by F.L. Griffith and Herbert Thomson, was published in 1904 as The Demotic Magical 
Papyrus of London and Leiden (London: H. Grevel & co.). The spell in question appears in 
col. XXIII lines 1-22. In full, including the rubric (in Demotic in the papyrus) it runs: 

A spell to inflict (?) catalepsy (?) Formula. You take an ass's head, and you 
place it between your feet opposite the sun in the morning when it is about to 
rise, opposite it again in the evening when it goes to the setting, and you anoint 
your right foot with set-stone of Syria, and your left foot with clay, the soles 
(?) of your foot also : and place your right hand in front and your left hand 
behind, the head being between them. You anoint your hand, of your two 
hands, with ass's blood, and the two fnz (?corners) of your mouth, and utter 
these charms towards the sun in the morning and evening of four days, then he 
sleeps. If you wish to make him die, you do it for seven days, you do its 
magic, you bind a thread of palm-fibre to your hand, a mat (?) of wild palm- 
fibre to your phallus and your head; very excellent. This is the invocation 
which you utter before the sun : 

"I invoke thee who art in the void air, terrible, invisible, almighty, god of 
gods, dealing destruction and malting desolate, O thou that hatest a household 
well established. When thou wast cast out of Egypt and out of the country thou 
wast entitled, "He that destroyeth all and is unconquered." I invoke thee, 
Typhon Seth, I perform thy ceremonies of divination, for I invoke thee by thy 
powerful name in (words?) which thou canst not refuse to hear : IOERBETH 
IOPAKERBETH 10 BOLCHOSETH lOPATATHNAX IOSORO IONEBOUTOSOUALETH 

AKTIOPHI Ereschigal, NEBOPOOALETH, Aberamenthoou, Lerthexanax, 
Ethreluoth, nemareba, Aemina, entirely(?) come to me and approach and 
strike down that person [here Crowley adds "Mathers"] with frost and fire; he 
has wronged me, and has poured out the blood of Typhon (?) beside(?) him or 
her: therefore I do these things." (add the usual).

This mostly follows the translation in Griffiths and Thomson. A more modern translation 
may be found in Betz (ed.), The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation (University of 
Chicago, 1986, 1992) as PDM xiv. 675-94. A couple of apparent transcription errors in the text 
as originally printed in the Goetia (ABEPAMENOOflN for ABEPAMENOOflT and Otone for 
TT00N02) have been corrected. 

The student will observe that the opening of the invocation is almost identically worded in 
the Greek to a passage in the "Bornless One" ritual (section IP in the Goetia version), possibly 
suggesting Typhonian influences in the latter. 

"KODSELIM" square. 

This talisman appears in Chapter X of Book 3 of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin 
the Mage (in the Mathers edition the top left and bottom right squares have C rather than K); 
its stated purpose is "To undo any Magic soever." 

Prefatory Note 

D.D.C.F. (Deo Duce Comite Ferro) was S.L. "MacGregor" Mathers, chief of the Hermetic 
Order of the Golden Dawn. His "translator" credit was in this instance bogus: the British 
Museum MSS. of the Lemegeton are in English. If the date is to be believed, then Crowley's 
final falling out with Mathers and proclamation of himself as the head of the Rosicrucian 
Order pre-dated the 1904 reception of The Book of the Law. 

"The Four Great Princes (acting notably under Martial influences)." The reference is 
probably to the Four Princes of Evil of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, 
Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan and Belial. In Liber LXI Crowley alleged that Mathers had 
"imprudently attracted to himself forces of evil too great and terrible for him to withstand" 
which he notes elsewhere were "probably Abramelin demons." Crowley claimed elsewhere 
that Mathers was obsessed by Mars and Geburah. 

S.V.A. and H. were "Swami Vive Ananda" (a.k.a. Madame Horos, Madame Helena, Edith 
Loleta, Dis Debar) and Theo Horos (Frank Jackson), a couple of occult con-artists who pulled 
a scam on Mathers (Mrs. Horos convinced him that she was Soror S.D.A., Anna Sprengel, 
the supposed German Master who authorised the founding of the Golden Dawn, who had not 
died as had been reported) and procured from him the ritual of the G.D. which they then used 
to extract money from the credulous. They were imprisoned for rape in December 1901; 
sensational newspaper coverage around the trial did much damage to the reputation of the 
G.D. An account of the "investigation by a competent Skryer" by J. F. C. Fuller using 
information supplied by Crowley appears in Equinonx I (4) pp. 176-7. The Latin quotation is 
from vol. I of Kabbalah Denudata (p. 505) and may comprise a further subtle dig at Mathers. 

"Ex Deo Nascimur &c": Lat., "From God we are born; in Jesus we die; by the Holy Spirit 
we live again." A Rosicrucian commonplace; vide the Fama Fraternitatis. 

"Mountain of A." Abiegnus. A name in later Rosicrucian literature for the "Mountain of the 
Philosphers" depicted in Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians, the symbolic burying-place of 
Christian Rosencreutz. See for example the Adeptus Minor ritual of the R.R. et A.C. as given 
in Regardie (ed.) The Golden Dawn and in an abridged form in Equinonx I (3). 

"Day of C.C." Corpus Christi. This was the G.D. interpretation of the "day C." when, 
according to the Fama, members of the Rosicrucian Order were bound to meet at a certain 
place or send cause of their absence.

Preliminary Invocation 

This is an adaptation, possibly by Allan Bennett, of a GraecoEgyptian ritual of exorcism 
known as the "Stele of Jeu the Hieroglyphist" (PGM V:96-i72). While sometimes cited as 
the "Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia" its connection with the Goetia is modern, deriving 
from Crowley's publication (probably also from private magical work by Crowley and others 
prior to that publication where the two were used in conjunction). The Greek text of the 
British Museum papyrus now known as PGM V (P. Lond. 46), with an English translation, 
was published in 1852 by Charles Wycliffe Godwin (Fragment of a Grce coEgyptian Work 
upon Magic, Cambridge: Deighton). 

Footnotes are transcribed from the two copies of the "Preliminary Invocation" in the First 
Impressions edition where they appeared as MS marginalia and interpolations; one set by 
Crowley from his personal copy, a second set by Gerald Yorke, collated from the former plus 
others unidentified sources. Text in angle brackets in these notes describes figures which I 
did not consider worth including in my occult symbols font. Crowley's final working up of 
the ritual into which many of the ideas appearing in those notes were incorporated is Liber 
Samekh which was published as Appendix IV of Magick in Theory and Practice. 

The Greek text as given in Preisendanz (ed.), Papyri Grce cce Magicaw. I, follows (the Greek 
title is here omitted); I have given breathings but not accents - in any case neither would have 
been present on the original MS; 'barbarous names' are printed in small caps. For "tov deiva"

A number of transcription errors in the voces magica occurred in the Goetia version; I have 
not ventured to correct these, since these names are for the most part corrupt to the point of 
being meaningless in any language in any case (some of Crowley's glosses do hinge on the 
erroneous reading). However, the above also contains a few conjectural restorations (of 
damaged places in the MS; flagged by angle brackets) and corrections by Preisendanz, e.g. 
APBAGIAfl for ap . . ©IAfl, iABAae iao for IB . . eiAfi, Arm ('holy') for AriE, etc. 

This is followed by a short rubric (English translation by D. E. Aune from Betz, op. cit): 

Preparation for the above ritual: Write the formula [ovofia] on a new sheet of 
papyrus, and after extending it from one of your temples to the other, read the 
6 names, while you face north saying: 

vnora^ov fioi -navra ra dai^ovia, 

iva [tot tjv VTrrjKOOt; naq dai^ov ovpavioq kcii aiQepioq, 

kcii emyeioq kcii imoyeioq kcii %epcraio<; kcii evvdpoq 

Kai iracra emTTOfiTTTj kcii [/,ao~rit; tj deov. 
And all daimons will be obedient to you. The beneficial sign is :> 

(virora^ov fioi iravra ra daifiovia K.r.X. is the prototype for the "Hear me and make all 
spirits subject unto me" refrain which does not occur in the body of the original invocation. 
The rest of Aune's translation is omitted to keep within the limits of fair use.) 

t denotes eta and denotes omega; umlauts over other vowels simply indicate that the vowel 
in question and the preceding one are pronounced distinctly. In their absence, 31, St, 01, HI, SH, 
tU, and OU are pronounced as single sounds (ai as in "aisle", ei as in "veil", oi as in "oil", ui as 
in "quit", au as the 'ou' in "loud", eu as in "feud", ou as in "route" — pronunciation 
information from Wenham, Elements of New Testament Greek). 



74 



Note in the IP section the fifth of the voces magica is 000 not DOO; similarly 00 not DO after 
SABRIAM in the final section. The miscopying occurred in the execrable de Lawrence piracy 
of the Goetia and has been perpetuated by other writers, possibly because in the blackletter 
typeface used by Crowley capital D and O were similar. Similarly the lower-case x and r are 
very similar, so de Lawrence miscopied ABRASAX as ABRASAR in the third and sixth 
sequences of voces magica. 

The Initiated Interpretation of Ceremonial Magic. 

This essay was reprinted in the notes to Crowley's Sword of Song and in turn reprinted in vol. 
ii of his Collected Works. Some additional footnotes from the latter publication have been 
added in. 

Preliminary Definition of Magic. 

Crowley scholar Martin Starr has sourced this to a 1656 English translation of Themis Aurce, a 
Rosicrucian work by Michael Maier. 

Brief Introductory Description. 

The Lemegeton is a ij^-century English compilation of magical texts attributed to Solomon. 
The Goetia is itself a composite: the praxis appears based partly on the Fourth Book of 
pseudo-Agrippa and partly on the Key of Solomon; the conjurations are closely or identically 
worded to Robert Turner's English translation (pub. 1655) of the Heptameron, sl i6 th -century 
Grimoire of planetary magick (falsely attributed to Peter of Abano) which was bound up with 
the Fourth Book and the catalogue of spirits is an adaptation of the "Book of the Offices of 
the Spirits" published by Wier in 1563 as Pseudomonarchia dee monumfrom a magical MS. in 
his possession. This text had 69 spirits; the compiler of the Goetia added some to bring the 
number up to 72 in accordance with the legend in the Pseudomonarchia which speaks of the 
72 chief spirits bound up in the brazen vessel by Solomon. Further, the fourth spirit in Wier's 
list, the Prince and Duke Pruflas or Bufas, is omitted in the Goetia. It may be significant that 
this spirit was also omitted in the version of the Pseudomonarchia published by Scot in his 
Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), from a MS. collection of magical rituals in English compiled 
by one "T.R." The Goetia also perpetuates a few other errors or odditites from that 
translation. 

The Theurgia Goetia lists 31 principal spirits and enumerates an astronomical number of 
subordinates of whom relatively few are named; of the 31, 20 are referred to the points of the 
compass and the other 11 are said to wander and have no fixed place. It is possible that the 
Theurgia-Goetia was partly based on the Steganographia of Trithemius by someone who did 
not realise that the latter was primarily a work of cryptography. The apparently oxymoronic 
title (historically yoyreia was used as a term of abuse by those who claimed to practice 
Beovpyia for what other magicians did) is accounted for by the mixed nature of the spirits (and 
the fact that the words had shifted somewhat in meaning by the Renaissance). 

The Ars Paulina contains a catalogue of Angels for the 12 hours of the day and night, and for 
the 12 signs and 360 degrees of the Zodiac; they are also attributed to the seven classical 
Planets. 

The Ars Almadel is probably of medieval origin: it divides up the powers it summons into 
four "Altitudes", seemingly referred to the cardinal points of the Zodiac. Both the Pauline 
Art and Art Almadel (alongside the Notary Art and "Art of Revelations" concerning which 
latter I have no further information) were denounced by Agrippa in his de Vanitate. 



75 



The Ars Nova is a kind of appendix which appears in one MS (BL Sloane 2731) where it 
occupies one and a half sides of a single folio leaf: it contains an extended prayer associated 
with the names on the circle and triangle of the Goetia (it appears in this edition as 
"Explanation of Certain Names &c"), along with a short and garbled conjuration containing 
some highly corrupt Hebrew names, probably also connected with the Goetia as it mentions 
the brazen vessel; and finally, the "Mighty Oration", a lengthy curse targetted at anyone who 
steals the book. 

The Ars Nova should not be confused with the Ars Notoria (Notary Art) attributed variously 
to Solomon and Apollonius of Tyanaea, which latter rather appears to be a medieval magical 
derivative of classical art of memory, based around the contemplation of images or notce 
while repeating prayers. The Ars Notoria was condemned by Aquinas (cited in Yates, Art of 
Memory) and various Renaissance writers such as Erasmus and Agrippa (in De vanitate &c); 
Robert Turner produced an English translation which was made less than useful by the 
omission of the figures: this translation was incorporated into some later MSS. and printed 
editions of the Lemegeton. Some figures from medieval MSS. of the Ars Notoria are printed 
in an article in a volume called Conjuring Sprits: Texts and Traditions of Medieval Ritual 
Magic, edited by Clare Fanger (Stroud: Sutton). 

A few complete editions of the Lesser Key have been printed since the Mathers-Crowley 
edition of the Goetia was issued. One, edited by Nelson White, appears to have been 
prepared from either Sloane 2731, or a codex of similar content, and omits the Ars Nova on 
the grounds that the editor considered it worthless. A more recent and thorough edition, 
edited by Joseph Petersen (Red Wheel / Weiser, 2002) was prepared from various codices and 
includes the Ars Notoria (mainly following Turner's translation). 

Crowley's threatened "History of the Order of the Golden Dawn" did not manifest under that 
title; see instead the instalments of The Temple of Solomon the King by J. F. C. Fuller (based 
on Crowley's notebooks) published in Equinox vol. I nos. 2, 3 and 4, as well as The 
Magicians of the Golden Dawn by Ellic Howe and Ritual Magic in England by Francis King. 

Shemhamphorash. 

The Shem ha-Mephorash (tSnOBPI Off) is the "Divided Name" or "Name of Extension" 
derived by Kabbalists from three consecutive verses in the Book of Exodus, each of which 
has 72 letters in the original Hebrew. By writings these verses out in rows, the first and third 
right to left as usual, the second left to right, and reading down the columns, 72 three-letter 
names are obtained. On the basis that the first verse mentions "the angel of the Elohim", 
from each three- letter group the name of an Angel is obtained by appending either TT or Tfcfc. 
The analogy with the 72 spirits of the Goetia should be obvious. 

For eight spirits, two forms of the seal were given by Mathers. In most cases the variations 
are minor, attributable to divergence from repeated copying: any given MS would only have 
had one. The exception is Bune, where at least one MS gives two significantly different forms. 
Further, the proportions of some of the seals have been squashed or stretched somewhat to fit 
them inside the circular borders (not present in most MSS); compare the forms in this edition 
with those given by Waite in Book of Black Magic and of Pacts and by Hyatt and DuQuette in 
their edition of the Goetia, or the forms from Sloane MS 3825 by Joseph Petersen in his 
electronic edition. 

Where Mathers has remarked unusual or variant readings in the description of a spirit in a 
footnote, I have in many instances cross-referenced to the corresponding entry in the Pseudo- 
monarchia. Issues that cannot be dealt with in a brief footnote are discussed below. 



76 



Two handwritten marginal notes by Crowley to this section which appeared in the First 
Impressions edition are omitted; as in one instance there was no obvious citation point (the 
note read "I think he can only be invoked at this time" and appeared at the bottom of the page 
with the descriptions of Paimon, Buer and Gusion) and the other one was partially illegible 
and I could make no sense of it. 

It is perhaps appropriate to give notice of the system of Angelic Hierarchies alluded to in 
various of the descriptions of the Spirits, since it is not mentioned in many of the modern 
works of Qabalistic reference such as 777. It is due to a Platonizing Christian mystic and 
theologian known as pseudo-Dionysus (ca. 5 century C.E.; his system was largely plagiarised 
from the Platonist Proclus) and postulates nine orders of celestial spirits, to wit: Seraphim, 
Kerubim, Thrones; Dominations (or Dominions), Powers, Virtues; Principalities, Archangels, 
Angels. Sometimes they are referred to the Sephiroth from Kether to Yesod in that order, 
with the "Blessed Souls" placed in Malkuth to fill out the scheme. 

3: VASSAGO does not appear in the Pseudomonarchia. Waite in Book of Black Magic and of 
Pacts states that he is also invoked in ceremonial crystallomancy by self-styled practitioners 
of "White Magic" but gives no specifics, although he does give a variant form of the seal said 
to be used in "White Magic." 

13: BELETH. The Pseudomonarchia mentions that Beleth, in common with many of the other 
spirits, has hopes to return to the Seventh Throne, "quod minus credibile." 

26: BUNE. According to the version of the Goetia in Sloane 3825,which gives both forms of 
the seal, it is rather the more complex form, given first, which is best. 

32: ASMODAY. The sentence "When the Exorcist hath a mind to call him..." has been much 
garbled, largely due to "T.R.'s" mistranslation from the Latin of the Pseudomonarchia, 
compounded by misunderstanding of i6 th -century useage by later copyists. The Latin runs: 
Cum hujus officia exercet exorcista, sit fortis, cautus & in pedibus stans: si vero coopertus 
fuerit, ut in omnibus detegatur, efficiet: Quod si non fecerit exorcista, ab Amaymone in 
cunctis decipietur. Approx: "When the exorcist employs his [Asmodai's] offices, let him [the 
exorcist] be strong, wary [lit. "warned"], standing on his feet, for should he be overwhelmed, 
he will be exposed in everything: but if the exorcist does not do this he will be deceived in 
everything by Amaymon." In the powers of Asmoday, "Invincible" is probably a copyist's 
error for "Invisible" (Wier has Hominem reddit invisibilem), Scot "invisible." 

33. GaAp. The entry for Gaap in the Pseudomonarchia goes off on a long digression, outlining 
a legend concerning how Cham (Ham) son of Noah was the first human after the Flood to 
invoke evil spirits, and mentioning many unspeakable things (nefaria) done by "exorcists"; also 
refusing to disclose the means whereby Gaap (or possibly Beleth, the Latin is ambiguous) may 
be constrained by an Exorcist who cannot get him to appear or show himself, since that too is 
nefandum. 

35: MARCHOSIAS. According to the Pseudomonarchia, the form of Marchosias is lupce 
ferocissimce cum alis gryphi, cauda serpentina, & ex ore nescio quid evomens.. "of a 
ferocious she- wolf with the wings of a gryphon, a serpentine tail, and vomiting I don't know 
what out of its mouth." Wier also remarks that he was deceived in his hope. 

54: MURMUR. A manufacturer of "Heavy Metal" and "Goth" jewellry and accessories 
recently added to their product line a pendant in the form of the seal of Murmur (it also bears 
the Masonic square and compasses for no clear reason), with a grossly misleading description 
in their catalogue. 



77 



55: OROBAS. Lon Milo DuQuette, in an edition of the Goetia co-edited by him with 
Christopher S. Hyatt, gives an account of an evocation of this spirit and suggests it was with 
its help that he became a Bishop of E.G.C. 

57: OSE. The Pseudomonarchia does not state how many legions Ose rules, so whoever 
compiled the Goetia had to guess. 

61: ZAGAN. According to the Pseudomonarchia Zagan, besides the trick with the metals and 
achieving what the British educational system generally fails in, transforms water into wine, 
and blood into oil, and the reverse; "T.R." gave 'wine' for 'oil.' 

64: FLAUROS has acquired sixteen more legions between the Pseudomonarchia and the 
Goetia. 

67: AMDUSIAS. The thing with the trees has been garbled due to "T.R." mistranslating and 
possibly also failing to understand a Latin idiom: Pseudomonarchia has ut ... abores ad 
exorcista? genu se inclinent, lit. "that trees bend the knee to the Exorcist" probably meaning 
"that the trees shall be subject to the exoricst." 

68: BELIAL. The Pseudomonarchia assigns 80 legions to Belial. The entry for Belial in the 
Pseudomonarchia includes an account of the myth of Solomon's sealing up the spirits in the 
brazen vessel. While only listing 69 spirits, the Pseudomonarchia version of the myth states 
that 72 kings along with their legions were sealed up in the brass vessel; it also gives various 
other details not included in the Goetia. The writer presents himself not as Solomon himself, 
but as one who learnt the Art from Solomon; he angrily rebuts the claim that Solomon, 
seduced by the cunning of a certain woman, once inclined himself to pray before the idol of 
Belial, asserting rather that Solomon accomplished all his works by divine virtue which 
never forsook him. 

Crowley's note from 1923 e.v. possibly alludes to various workings directed at this spirit, in 
particular one on the 9 th of March 1918 e.v. "to create Belial as 2nd dec. Aquarius, night- 
demon - to bring 'earned success.' " 

70: Seere, in common with Dantalion and Andromalius, does not appear in the 
Pseudomonarchia. 

71: Dantalion appears to have been the first Goetic spirit to get its own fansite on the World 
Wide Web. 

Observations. 

The compiler of the Goetia evidently left it to the ingenium of the Magician to determine 
which of the four Great Kings each spirit was under; since the rulership or assignment to a 
quarter is only given for a few, and there is no obvious pattern. 

Classified List of the 72 Chief Spirits. 

Planetary symbols were handwritten in by Crowley in his personal copy. 

In the Hebrew versions of the names from the Rudd MSS (Harley 6483). I have not 
reproduced Hebrew pointing. 

In 777 (cols. CLV to CLXVI) Crowley gave a different set of Hebrew spellings for the 72 
Spirts, assigning them to the Decans by day and night. I reproduce this information below, 
adding the key numbers of the spirits for ease of reference, and the attributions to Tarot 
number cards thereby implied. Planetary symbols indicate the rank of the spirit (in the 
printed edition, that for 50, Furcas, was given as 9 rather than t>). It will be observed that 
Crowley has largely dropped Latinised endings such as -es, -us, -ius, -ion, etc.

Yet another set of spellings and astrological attributions, due to the order Aurum Solis, may 
be found in The Sword and the Serpent by Denning and Phillips, or the third edition of 
Godwin's Cabalistic Encyclopedia. 

The Magical Circle. 
The figure of the circle and triangle has been redrawn and coloured. The sequence of names 
around the serpent runs, for each Sephirah from Kether to Yesod inclusive, the Divine Name, 
the name of the Sephirah, the Archangel, the Choir of Angel, the Hebrew name of the 
"Heaven of Assiah" corresponding, then the appropriate planetary symbol, or an abbreviation 
for the Latin equivalent. Malkuth is represented by the square in the centre, which in some 
codices has Terra (earth) written on it. 

The Vessel of Brass. 
The Hebrew on the band around the first form of the Brazen vessel reads: 
(front) :tel3KPl : te^S : teoa : rVTltf UHt 
Asher Eheyeh : Gabriel : Michael : Haniel 

(back):torpi* : a^sam : kthkik or torn* : torpor : tea : ten : KrminK 

Ararita : Chashmalim : Tzadqiel or Ararita : Raphael : Kamael : Tzadqiel : Tzaphqiel

The Secret Seal. 

Mathers' long note appears to have been omitted in the de Lawrence edition. Not that it was 
any great loss. 

The Adoration at the Bath. 

This is a traditional versicle for purification: the source is the 51st Psalm, via the Ordinary of 
the Mass. For "purge" read "sprinkle" or "asperge"; you are not taking a laxative. I do not 
know what the original Hebrew means (NIV has "cleanse"), but "purge" is certainly not a 
reasonable translation into modern English of aspergo -ere. 

The Adoration at the induing of the Vestments. 

An adaptation of a prayer in the Key of Solomon. Another version occurs in the Heptameron; 
one almost identically worded to the Goetia in one of the magical texts interpolated into the 
1665 third edition of Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft. 

The Conjuration to call forth any of the aforesaid Spirits. 

Passages in this and the second conjuration closely parallel many elements of two of the 
conjurations in the Heptameron (which in turn probably derived from earlier Solomonic 
texts; in particular the series of divine names which Moses and others are said to have 
invoked to bring down the plagues on Egypt and work other wonders, is analagous though 
not identical to a long section in the "stronger and more potent conjuration" in the Clavicle). 
Re Mathers' third note to the second conjuration; the Heptameron has et per sedem Adonai. 
ICTROS is probably a corruption of ISCHUROS (Grt, "mighty"); pseudo-Abano has et per O 
Theos [God], Iscyros [Mighty], Athanatos [Deathless], Paracletos [Assistant (or 
Intercessor)] in place of the two sets of three Greek names following "by the Seat of ADONAI." 

The Constraint. 

"PREYAI or PRERAl" etc. is a classic example of the pernicious tendency of scribal glosses or 
notes to be incorporated into the text of repeatedly copied documents (cf I John V, 7-8): in the 
hypothetical original of that conjuration, one of the names would have been written. The 
gloss could mean that in one codex the word was ambiguous due to poor handwriting and so 
could have been either, or that the scribe (possibly Mathers) had access to multiple codices 
some giving one reading, some the other. In actual practice only one name should be used (it 
probably doesn't matter which since they are all horribly corrupted in any case). 

Aye, Saraye is probably a corruption of Eheyeh Asher Eheyeh (PPPIN ItPtf PPPltt). 

The Address unto the Spirit on his coming. 

Again, adapted from speeches in the Heptameron. Pseudo-Abano has conclusionem 
(probably best translated "doom") rather than 'confusion' (one MS. of the Goetia has 
'conclusion'). "Bathal or Vathat" is probably another example of duplication from scribal 
gloss (pseduo-Abano has Bathat, vel Vachat; some MSS. have just "Bathat"). Crowley's 
note (handwritten into his personal copy) hinges on a point of Latin grammar. 

Explanation of Certain Names. 

This occurs on the final leaf of Sloane 2731, which Ben Rowe identifies with the Ars Nova, 
suggesting that rather than being an 'explanation' of anything, it is a prayer to be said either 
while writing out the circle and triangle, or in consecrating the place of working. It will be 
noted that besides several names being miscopied a number are omitted altogether, possibly 
because the author of this piece was working from a defective version of the figure of the 
Circle.

Y Conjurations ofy e Booke Goetia ... rendered into y e Magicall or Angelike Language. 

This "Magicall or Angelike Language" is the Angelic language, called Enochian by modern 
occultists, which emerged from the ceremonial skrying of John Dee and Edward Kelly in the 
1580' s. Through the mediumship of Kelly, Dee received nineteen invocations or "Keys" in 
this language, together with their English translations. The extant vocabulary is 
comparatively small, of the order of a few hundred words, but sufficient to allow magicians 
to compose new conjurations (as well as bad puns and erotic poetry), albeit in what one 
suspects is an awkward pidgin form of the language. The orthography used here is a semi- 
phonetic spelling, following rules employed in the Golden Dawn; while the Angelic language 
does contain definite vowel letters, many words are impronouncable without the insertion of 
additional vowel sounds. 'Z' is expanded into 'zod' or 'zoda'. 

These versions of the conjurations were omitted in the de Lawrence piracy; the 1995 Weiser 
"second edition" of the Goetia added an analysis and correction. It is here omitted; bar the 
correction of a few obvious typographical errors the intralineal Enochian-English 
conjurations are reproduced as they appear in facsimiles of the first edition; the student who 
wishes to conduct a deeper study of this aspect is referred to The Complete Enochian 
Dictionary by Donald Laycock (Askin, 1978; Weiser, 1994). 

Crowley additionally copied the first two Angelic 'Keys' with English translation onto the 
back endpapers of his personal copy; they are reproduced in the First Impressions edition. 

Second Conjuration: For "caelazod" for "firmament of wrath" read "caelazod vonupeho" 
(calz vonpho). Crowley apparently miscopied the First Key, as this error appears in Liber 
Chanokh and the version of the Key handwritten into his copy of the Goetia as well, 
"zodimibe" (Izimb) for "veil" is not elsewhere attested. Possibly an error for, or modification 
of, zimz, glossed 'vestures' in the First Key. 

Invocation of the King: "bobanu" (Ibobn) for "West" is not attested in the Dee material; in 
the Ninth Key, soboln (sobolanu) is glossed "in the West." In so far as the Angelic nouns 
appear to be at least partially declined, it also should be noted that babage is glossed "in the 
South" in the Fourth and Twelfth Keys, but babegen "of the South" in the Thirteenth. 

Enochian names according to ranks of the spirits (these are mostly explained by the planetary 
attributions): 

Knights: pu-ime. pu-im, glossed "sharp sickles" in the Third Key. 

Prelates: tabaame. Probably an error for, or variant of, tabaan (taba-anu), glossed 
"governer" in the Fifteenth key. 

Earls: nazodapesad. nazpsad, glossed "sword" in the First Key. 

Kings: rare, ror, glossed "the sun" in the First Key. 

Dukes: oheloka. Possibly an error for obloc (obeloca), glossed "garland" in the Sixth Key. 

Presidents: balazodareji. balzarg, glossed "stuards" (stewards) in the Third Key. 

Marquises: geraa. graa, glossed "the moon" in the First Key.
