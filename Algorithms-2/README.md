# Algoritmos 2 (Algorithms 2)
I took this course during my 3rd year at UFMG.

The first project is a python implementation of the LZ78 algorithm for encoding and decoding texts.

The second project is a python implementation of a 2-approximate algorithm for the k-center problem.

All projects have documentations (in portuguese), and they can all be found in their respective Documentação.pdf files.
