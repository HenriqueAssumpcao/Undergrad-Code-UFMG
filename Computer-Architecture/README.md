# Arquitetura de Computadores (Computer Architecture)
I took this course during my 2nd year at UFMG.

The first project contains multiple simple implementations in ASSEMBLY.

The second project of partial implementation in verilog of a RISC-V processor. The implementation is presented in a jupyter notebook, and we were tasked with implementing three missing features from the processor.

The third project is a simple python program that emulates cache memory.

The second project has a documentation (in portuguese), and the first and third projects contain only comments in the source code.
